<p>Things to be kept in mind while drawing a trend line are:
- Ensre that the trend line at least touches 2 points(Higher the better)
- Wicks can be joined by the trend line.
- Note: Wicks can be cut by the trend line. However the body <strong>should not</strong> be cut by the trend line.</p>

<h2 id="Candlestick%20bullish%20patterns">Candlestick bullish patterns</h2>

<h3 id="Bullish%20Engulfing">Bullish Engulfing</h3>

<ul>
<li>In this case, the second candle&#8217;s body (a bullish one) completely engulfs the previous day&#8217;s candle. Both the tail or the wick of the caldle of first bar are covered by the second one.</li>
<li>Such patterns are powerful if they are formed at the bottom of the correction in a bullish move or near the bottom of a bear move. Such patterns are also seen at the end of a consolidation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Morning%20Star">Morning Star</h3>

<ul>
<li>A Morning star is a bullish three candle pattern which is formed at the bottom of a down move&#47;trend.</li>
<li>The first candle = a big bearish candle which clearly defines the down move.</li>
<li>The second candle = a small candle, which is ideally a Doji candle(indecisive).</li>
<li>The third candle = a large bullish candle which closes near the top of the day.</li>
<li>The pattern signifies extreme selling as witnessed in the first candle, followed by a change of power as shown in the second candle and finally the bulls taking over the and regaining lost ground.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Hammer">Hammer</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Hammer formation is created when the open, high, and close are roughly the same price. Also, there is a long lower shadow, twice the length as the real body.</li>
<li>Hammer is MOST EFFECTIVE if it occurs at &#8220;Bottom of the downward trend&#8221;</li>
<li>It is considered as a Bullish Reversal Pattern.</li>
<li>Confirmation of the reversal is to be taken before taking any position.</li>
<li>The color of the real body is not important.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Inverted%20Hammer:">Inverted Hammer:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The long shadow is about two or three times of the real body.</li>
<li>Little or no lower shadow.</li>
<li>The color of the real body is not important.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: Hammer&#47;Inverted Hammer formed at the end of down trend with a bullish candle are a bit powerful as compared to bearish candles</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="Candlestick%20bearish%20patterns">Candlestick bearish patterns</h2>

<h3 id="Bearish%20Engulfing">Bearish Engulfing</h3>

<ul>
<li>In this case, the second candle&#8217;s body (a bearish one) completely engulfs the previous day&#8217;s candle. Both the tail or the wick of the caldle of first bar are covered by the second one.</li>
<li>It is more powerful if they are formed at the top of a up trend&#47;move.</li>

<h2 id="Indicators">Indicators</h2>

<ul>
<li>A mathematical tool that can be applied on security&#8217;s price giving a result that can be used to anticipate trends, volatility and price.</li>
<li>One of the most commonly used indicator is a Moving Average indicator.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Moving%20Average">Moving Average</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>A simple moving average is calculated by taking average of most recent closing prices of n time period.</p></li>
<li><p>Exponential Moving average applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially.</p></li>
<li><p>5 days moving average is like analyzing 1 week&#8217;s data</p></li>
<li><p>13 days moving average is like analyzing 1 fortnight&#8217;s data</p></li>
<li><p>26 days moving average is like analyzing 1 month&#8217;s data</p></li>
<li><p>In majority cases, the 5days Moving Average line is close to the CMP</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Stratergy%20-%20Buy">Stratergy - Buy</h3>

<ul>
<li>When 5 DEMA cuts the 13 DEMA from below, its an anticipatory buy.</li>
<li>When 5 DEMA cuts the 26 DEMA from below, its an confirmatory buy.</li>
<li>The buy call is strengthened if the volumes are also in the same direction.</li>
<li>If 5 DEMA cuts 13 DEMA and 26 DEMA on the same day with increased volumes, it&#8217;s a confirmatory buy.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: Instead of the word below if we use the word above it will be sell stratergy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moving average is an effective indecator, however it is treated as lagging indecator i.e. it generates delayed buy&#47;sell calls</p>
