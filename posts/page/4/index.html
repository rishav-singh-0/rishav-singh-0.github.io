Overview The Holonomic Drive Robot is an innovative, three-wheeled robot designed for precision path planning and image-based drawing. It combines advanced robotics algorithms, custom hardware, and creative problem-solving to deliver exceptional performance in a variety of tasks, from geometric pattern generation to drawing intricate images like logos.
Key Highlights 1. Motion Planning and Control Implemented a novel path-planning approach to optimize motor velocity and trajectory precision. Designed custom algorithms to address trajectory distortion caused by motor speed limitations. 2. Hardware and Software Integration Successfully integrated ESP32, eYFI Mega, stepper motors, and LiPo batteries into a cohesive system. Overcame challenges such as faulty motor drivers and optimized power delivery for reliability. 3. Image Processing and Simulation Extracted contours from images and translated them into robot motion commands. Utilized ROS and Gazebo for testing and refining the system in a simulated environment. 4. Real-Time Problem Solving Debugged critical hardware issues, such as malfunctioning motor drivers and damaged LiPo cells. Enhanced communication latency between the laptop and ESP32 from 1 second to 200ms by identifying and resolving protocol bottlenecks. 5. Creative Outputs Enabled the robot to draw patterns such as Lissajous figures (infinity loops) and complex logos. Developed a custom ink mixture to ensure visibility and erasability for pattern drawing. Technologies Used Hardware: ESP32, eYFI Mega, LiPo batteries, and stepper motors. Software: ROS for robot control, Gazebo for simulation, and Python, C for software logic. Tools & Libraries: OpenCV for image processing, AccelStepper for motor control, and custom ROS packages for integration. Development Timeline January - February 2023: Prototyping and Hardware Development Designed and built the physical robot body, integrating motor drivers, sensors, and controllers. Calibrated the camera with over 100 samples for precise localization. Debugged and optimized motor driver configurations, achieving simultaneous operation of all wheels. Developed non-blocking motor control using the AccelStepper library. March 2023: Software Refinement and Final Tests Created a contour extraction function for converting images into path points for drawing. Integrated a servo-based pen mechanism for on/off control during drawing operations. Conducted intensive testing, fixing indexing bugs, and optimizing scripts for various patterns, including the Snapchat logo and infinity shapes. Demonstrated successful path-following in a simulation environment using Gazebo. !assets/hola-collage 1.jpg Challenges Overcome Latency in Data Transmission: Resolved slow communication by identifying a missing newline character in transmitted data, reducing latency from 1 second to 200ms. Battery and Power Issues: Diagnosed and replaced faulty LiPo battery cells, ensuring uninterrupted operation. Hardware Failures: Addressed motor driver failures and loose connections with creative soldering solutions and robust wiring techniques. Achievements Successfully implemented conditional path-following to optimize motor velocity during complex path execution. Demonstrated precise image drawing with minimal distortion using camera-calibrated localization. Created a detailed documentation repository and shared project outcomes through YouTube videos, showcasing the robot’s capabilities. Media Video Demonstrations: Watch Demo Video Conclusion The Holonomic Drive Robot is a testament to innovative thinking, technical expertise, and perseverance. It serves as a versatile platform for robotics experimentation, offering potential applications in art, industrial automation, and beyond.

Money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how smart bankers, doctors and accountants who earned excellent grades in school may still struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due in large part to highly educated politicians and government officials making financial decisions with little or no training on the subject of money.
