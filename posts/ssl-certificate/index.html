Self-Signed Certificates
A self-signed certificate is a digital certificate that is not issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) but is signed by the entity it is certifying (e.g., your own server). These certificates are primarily used for internal testing, development environments, or scenarios where external trust is not required."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://blog.rishavs.in/posts/ssl-certificate/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.2211ca3164be7830024f6aad2b3a2e520843a64f8f048445c3401c1249aa051d.css integrity="sha256-IhHKMWS+eDACT2qtKzouUghDpk+PBIRFw0AcEkmqBR0=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://blog.rishavs.in/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://blog.rishavs.in/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://blog.rishavs.in/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://blog.rishavs.in/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://blog.rishavs.in/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://blog.rishavs.in/posts/ssl-certificate/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.rishavs.in/posts/ssl-certificate/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Rishav's Digital Garden"><meta property="og:title" content="SSL Certificate"><meta property="og:description" content="An SSL certificate is a digital certificate issued by a trusted third-party authority known as a Certificate Authority (CA).

How a Certificate File Looks Certificates are typically encoded in PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) format and look like this:\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIIC8DCCAdigAwIBAgIUcyDOgjHj0W3... ...QwMDIxMTgxNzAwWjAfMR0wGwYDVQQDDBQt... ...eVc1OSn+nnAcAzU2e5/s= -----END CERTIFICATE----- To create a certificate see [Creating Openssl Certificate]({\u003c ref “/posts/creating-openssl-certificate/” \u003e}})\nBreakdown of Certificate Content Header and Footer: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE----- Indicates the start and end of the Base64-encoded certificate. Version: Specifies the X.509 version (usually v3). Serial Number: Unique number assigned to the certificate by the issuer. Signature Algorithm: Indicates the algorithm used to sign the certificate (e.g., SHA256withRSA). Issuer: Entity that issued the certificate. For self-signed certificates, it’s the same as the subject. Validity Period: Contains Not Before and Not After fields, specifying the certificate’s active duration. Subject: Information about the entity the certificate represents (e.g., domain name, organization). Public Key: Contains the public key used for encryption. Extensions: Additional data, such as: Key Usage: Specifies permitted uses (e.g., SSL/TLS). Subject Alternative Name (SAN): Lists additional domains covered by the certificate. Signature: The digital signature applied by the issuer.
