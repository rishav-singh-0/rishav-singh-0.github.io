A Farmer is the CEO, COO, CFO, Sales manager, Investment manager of a propritary fariming firm.
It will directly effect his income if he is not good in even one of the fields

Before the cropping season:
What to sow, when to sow, credit availability, plan for inputs, land preparation, soil nutrient status

Farmers has to have the access to the data that howmuch has it rained, moisture level in soil.
When to sow based on forcasting
Svaings, loans &ndash;> moneylenders
Seed varity and quality, selection from number of options, authenticity of seeds
Land preparation, machinery and labours, funds for that
Gap filling for requirements of soil for a crop, suppliments, fertilizers, NPK (should be made easy to understand)

During the cropping season:

choose appropriate agriculture technology
monitor the progress of crop
observe anomalies and take action, monitor weather
labour/machinery management for sowing and intercultural operations
water management
weed/pests/ wild animals management
respond to climate contingencies
in case of damege file claim for insurance

After the cropping season:

Harvesting based on weather conditions, checking if crop is actually ready
labour management
primary processing, storage
market assessment, where and when to sell
grading/sorting/packing/transportation
value addition, negotiation for better prices
realization of prices
repayments(loans, etc.)
surplus investment planning(future planning)

During the lean season:
