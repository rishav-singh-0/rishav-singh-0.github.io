We do see trends even while watching IPL matches! Uptrends It is a collection of moves and down moves. Uptrend is evidenced by creation of higher highs and higher lows. Downtrends It is a collection of Down moves and Up moves. Downtrend is evidenced by creation of Lower highs and Lower lows. Thumb rule: NEVER BUY IN AN DOWNTREND! Sideways trend Downtrend is evidenced by prices moving within a range. Thumb rule: NEVER TRADE IN AN SIDEWAYS TREND! WAIT AND WATCH FOR THE DIRECTION OF BREAKOUT! Special Tip: Call option can be sold in sideways trend as time value is going down! Charts Charts and patterns are integral part of technical analysis\nLine chart It is a most basic of all charts Just like line that connects the closing price over a time frame There is no trading range Bar charts Left line represents opening price Right line represents closing price Red = down Blue/Green = up Volume Bar chart Number of shares that change hands between sellers and buyers Price movement is more sinificant when volume is above average Candlestick chart Vertical line represents the trading range Green/White Chadlestick = Bullish Red/Black Candlestick = Bearish Plotting trend lines Visually, a trend can be understood. However, if we plot a trend line, then, it can help us for further analysis.\nThings to be kept in mind while drawing a trend line are:\nEnsre that the trend line at least touches 2 points(Higher the better) Wicks can be joined by the trend line. Note: Wicks can be cut by the trend line. However the body should not be cut by the trend line. Support and Resistance Support level is a price level where the price trends to find support as it is going down Resistance level is a price where the price trends to find resistance as it is going up Importance Support and resistance analysis is an important part of trends because it can be used to make trading decisions and identify when a trend is reversing. A resistance once broken becomes a support and a support once broken becomes a resistance. Breakout The penetration of support and resistance level is called breakout Volumes Volumes provide us with the intensity of a given price move(very important element of technical analysis) If current day’s volume is higher than imidiate five previous volume bars, its a good confirmation on volumes. Candlestick bullish patterns Bullish Engulfing In this case, the second candle’s body (a bullish one) completely engulfs the previous day’s candle. Both the tail or the wick of the caldle of first bar are covered by the second one. Such patterns are powerful if they are formed at the bottom of the correction in a bullish move or near the bottom of a bear move. Such patterns are also seen at the end of a consolidation. Morning Star A Morning star is a bullish three candle pattern which is formed at the bottom of a down move/trend. The first candle = a big bearish candle which clearly defines the down move. The second candle = a small candle, which is ideally a Doji candle(indecisive). The third candle = a large bullish candle which closes near the top of the day. The pattern signifies extreme selling as witnessed in the first candle, followed by a change of power as shown in the second candle and finally the bulls taking over the and regaining lost ground. Hammer The Hammer formation is created when the open, high, and close are roughly the same price. Also, there is a long lower shadow, twice the length as the real body. Hammer is MOST EFFECTIVE if it occurs at “Bottom of the downward trend” It is considered as a Bullish Reversal Pattern. Confirmation of the reversal is to be taken before taking any position. The color of the real body is not important. Inverted Hammer: The long shadow is about two or three times of the real body. Little or no lower shadow. The color of the real body is not important. Note: Hammer/Inverted Hammer formed at the end of down trend with a bullish candle are a bit powerful as compared to bearish candles\nCandlestick bearish patterns Bearish Engulfing In this case, the second candle’s body (a bearish one) completely engulfs the previous day’s candle. Both the tail or the wick of the caldle of first bar are covered by the second one. It is more powerful if they are formed at the top of a up trend/move. Evening Star It is formed when a green candle is followed by a doji candle which is then folliwed by a big bearish candle This will be most powerful when it is formed at the end of uptrend Similar but Different Indicators A mathematical tool that can be applied on security’s price giving a result that can be used to anticipate trends, volatility and price. One of the most commonly used indicator is a Moving Average indicator. Moving Average A simple moving average is calculated by taking average of most recent closing prices of n time period.\nExponential Moving average applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially.\n5 days moving average is like analyzing 1 week’s data\n13 days moving average is like analyzing 1 fortnight’s data\n26 days moving average is like analyzing 1 month’s data\nIn majority cases, the 5days Moving Average line is close to the CMP\nStratergy - Buy When 5 DEMA cuts the 13 DEMA from below, its an anticipatory buy. When 5 DEMA cuts the 26 DEMA from below, its an confirmatory buy. The buy call is strengthened if the volumes are also in the same direction. If 5 DEMA cuts 13 DEMA and 26 DEMA on the same day with increased volumes, it’s a confirmatory buy. Note: Instead of the word below if we use the word above it will be sell stratergy\nMoving average is an effective indecator, however it is treated as lagging indecator i.e. it generates delayed buy/sell calls\nMACD(Moving Averages Convergence Divergence) MACD is calculated by subtracting 26 days moving average from moving average of 12 days\nI.e. MACD = 12 DEMA - 26 DEMA\nWe get various amounts by subtracting the EMAs. MACD line is formed by joining all these dots.\nMACD \u003e 0 –\u003e strength\nMACD \u003c 0 –\u003e weakness\nWhen the MACD is above 0, it means that 12 days moving average is higher than the 26 days moving average\nThis is bullish since current trend is more bullish as compared to a medium term trend.\nIdeally we see weakness first and then price falls\nSimilarly, we see strength first and then price rises\nSignal line is 9 DEMA of MACD\nMACD Line — Blue line (Fast line)\nSignal Line — Orange line (Slow line)\nHistogram — Bars (Indicates the difference between MACD line and Signal Line)\nStatergy If MACD line cuts the signal line from above = SELL If MACD line cuts the signal line from below = Buy RSI(Relative Strength Index) The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes. RS1 is an oscillator ie it moves to and fro within a range. The range is from 0 to 100. The indicator was originally developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. It evaluates overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other assets. RSI = 100 - 100/(1+RS) RS = Average Gain over specified Period / Average Loss over the same period Generally RSI is calculated for 14 days RSI will rise as the number and size of positive closes increase, and it will fall as the number and size of losses increases Statergy Traditional RSI \u003c 30 indicates an oversold position (Buy Signal) RSI \u003e 70 indicates an overbought position (Sell Signal) However, if the security/ overall market is very bullish, it may remain in the overbought position for a long period of time. In such a situation, 80 can be taken as an overbought signal.\nSimilarly, if the security/ overall market is very bearish, it may remain in the oversold position for a long period of time. In such a situation, 20 can be taken as an oversold signal.\nThe new way RSI \u003e 60 = Uptrend continues = BUY RSI taking support at 60 = Bullish RSI \u003c 40 = Downtrend = Stop Loss or SELL RSI facing resistance at 40 = Bearish RSI between 40 \u0026 60 is sideways trend Ideally take 8 to 10 months data\nStatergy for MACD + RSI Target price should be around 3-5% returns in timespan of maximum 10 days (swing) StopLoss will be equal to median of the breakout trend (opening+closing / 2) When there is: MACD bullish crossower RSI is above 60 Bollinger Bands 20 DEMA line acts as basic support if current price is above 20 DEMA Upper Bollinger band which stands at 2 standard deviations will act like resistance in 95% cases Lower BB which stands at 2 std will act as support in 95% cases BB Squeeze: If the squeeze is for longer duration and if the current candle breakes the upper bb then it is a BUY call Higher squeeze the better (min 1 month)\nStopLoss will be determind in the same way and trailing stoploss will be privious day’s candle’s low Fibonacci Retracement This theory is based upon the Fibonacci number sequence. Fibonacci numbers are such that they tend to repeat themselves in nature. These numbers were used to determine breeding cycles of rabbits and are now being used in architecture, art and trading. From petals of flowers to prices of stocks everything is said to be in this pattern. The number series starts with 0,1 and then the next numbers are derived by adding the previous two number and goes like 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233, …. Heard about the GOLDEN RATIO? Yes, that’s another creation of the Fibonacci number sequence it is the succeeding number divided by the preceding number eg: - 233/144= 1.6180. As far as technical analysis is concerned we have to look out for the % patterns that these numbers follow which is given below. 21/89= 0.2360 (23.60%) 34/89= 0.3820 (38.20%) 55/89= 0.6120 (61.20%) In stock market Golden Ratio can be used for the level from which stock can retrace How to draw fibonachi In an uptrend join the lowest point on the screen to the highest point on the screen(same for downtred) Take around 9 months data for better results Research some more\nBullish Chart Pattern Up Flag It is seen by Up move Sideways trend(cloth of the flag) Close above resistance If it is accompined by increase in volume, it is better Calculstion o price target: Calculate the distance from start of the pole(upmove) till the resistance(upper part of flag) Assume this distance as x, then price target will be x + support(lower cloth of flag) Time target = Number of candles from candle to breakout candle divided by 3 Inverted Head and Shoulder Close is above neckline Increased volumes on Breakout candle X = Vertical distance frorn Low of Head to Neckline Price Target = Intersection point of the neckline and Breakout candle + X Time Target = Number of candles from /1st Neck Point to Breakout candle divided by 3. Double bottom (W) Equal bottoms from the same downtrend White candle with increased volumes after 2nd bottom X = Vertical distance from double bottom level to highest point between 2 bottoms Target = Bottom Level + (X/2) Time = No. of candles from 1st bottom to white candle, divided by 3 Rounding Bottom Criteria:\nHistorically highly priced\nSharp fall\nConsolidation for minimum 2 years\nBreakout above the resistance from consolidation\nThis is a MULTI BAGGER Pattern\nThe study is to be done only on a monthly chart.\nPrice Target = Historic high, expected to be achived within 1 year\n2nd Price Target = 5 times of the breakout level, expected to be achived in 2 years from the breakout\nListing Breakout Market euphoria at the time of listing Price begins to consolidate after which it makes a new high Price is overvalued \u0026 thus drifts downwards for next 2 years. Price will justify the business valuations and will trade at this level for the next 8 to 10 months. As the business improves, the price will start moving upwards Price will reach an all time high level. Breakout above the old resistance. Bearish Chart Pattern Head and Shoulders This formation is characterized by 2 small peaks on either side of a larger peak Close is below neckline Increased volumes on Breakout candle X = Vertical distance from High of Head to Neckline Price Target = Intersection point of the neckline and Breakout candle — X Time Target = Number of candles from 1st Neck Point to Breakout candle divided by 3. Double Top Similar to H\u0026S with no head Equal bottoms from the same uptrend Black candle with increased volumes after 2nd top X = Vertical distance from double top level to the lowest point between 2 tops Target = Double Top Level - (X/2) Time = No. of candles from 1st top to black candle, divided by 3 ","wordCount":"2342","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-10-10T22:45:00Z","dateModified":"2021-10-10T22:45:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.rishavs.in/posts/technical-analysis/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Rishav's Digital Garden","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.rishavs.in/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.rishavs.in/ accesskey=h title="Rishav's Digital Garden (Alt + H)">Rishav's Digital Garden</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.rishavs.in/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.rishavs.in/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.rishavs.in/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Technical Analysis</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-10-10 22:45:00 +0000 UTC'>October 10, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;11 min</div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=analyzing-the-past>Analyzing the past<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#analyzing-the-past>#</a></h2><ul><li>It is a well established fact that stock prices show cyclical movements, similar to a business.</li><li>It is a process of identifying trends & trend reversals at an earlier stage to formulate buy-sell strategy.</li><li>A good technical Analyst always considers facts.
