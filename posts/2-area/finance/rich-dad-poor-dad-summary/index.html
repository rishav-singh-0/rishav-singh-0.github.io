Our staggering national debt is due in large part to highly educated politicians and government officials making financial decisions with little or no training on the subject of money.\nOne dad had a habit of saying, “I can’t afford it.” The other used to say, “How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question.

The reason positive thinking alone does not work is because most people went to school and never learned how money works, so they spend their lives working for money.\nLesson 1: The Rich Don’t Work For Money “If you learn life’s lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just continue to push you around. People do two things. Some just let life push them around. Others get angry and push back. But they push back against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They do not know it’s life that’s pushing.”\n“Life pushes all of us around. Some give up. Others fight. A few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to learn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like you fight.”\n“If you think I’m the problem, then you have to change me. If you realize that you’re the problem, then you can change yourself, learn something and grow wiser.”\n“The poor and the middle class work for money.” “The rich have money work for them.”\nYou see, true learning takes energy, passion, a burning desire. Anger is a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. When it comes to money, most people want to play it safe and feel secure. So passion does not direct them: Fear does.
