Hey there!

My name is **Rishav Singh** and I am yet another Tech Enthusiast.I am also an Electronics and Communication Engineer. 
I like and promote Open Source Softwares, GNU/Linux and other related stuff.

Here on this website I usually post guides, tutorials or notes based on my own experience and uses, 
idea is to make easy to follow and highly effective methods using as less words as possible.
