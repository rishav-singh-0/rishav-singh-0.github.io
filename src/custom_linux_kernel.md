# Compile your custom linux kernel

Date: 17 Sept. 2021

## Preparation

### Install Dependencies

```
sudo pacman -S base-devel xmlto kmod inetutils bc libelf git --needed
```

### Downloading source and local setup

It is recommended to create a separate build directory for your kernel(s). In this example, the directory kernelbuild will be created in the home directory:

```
mkdir ~/kernelbuild
cd ~/kernelbuild
```

Goto [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/) and download kernel source

```
wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.14.5.tar.xz
```
> Note: you can verify signature of the downloaded tarball if you want

Extract tarball

```
tar -xvJf linux-5.14.5.tar.xz
```

Check

## Kernel configuration

To finalise the preparation, ensure that the kernel tree is absolutely clean; do not rely on the source tree being clean after unpacking. To do so, first change into the new kernel source directory created, and then run the make mrproper command:

```
cd linux-5.14.5

# cean up the tree
make mrproper
```

copy config file

```
zcat /proc/config.gz > .config
```

make sure all configuration options have values that are required

```
make olddefconfig
```

### Another option(not recommended)
automatically detect the hardware and creates config based on just that
downside is that its not gonna detect anything which is not currently connected

```
make localmodconfig
```

### Menu driven configuration utility(best option)

```
make menuconfig
```

This should look somewhat like:

![make menuconfig](./images/custom_linux_kernel/1.png)

Here is the main part of research and knowing your hardware, Good Luck üëç with that.
When all the required configurations are done, save your configurations in `.config` file.

## Build the kernel

We can use -j flag to use multiple cores of cpu while compiling

```
make -j4
```

This process will normally take some time so grab a cup of coffee(it took around 1 hour for me)

## Installation


### Install the modules

<!-- This will build any modules that do not exist otherwise it will copy your modules to kernel modules directory -->

Once the kernel has been compiled, the modules for it must follow. First build the modules:

```
make modules -j4
```

Change to root user
```
sudo su
```

Then install the modules.

```
make modules_install -j4
```

This will copy the compiled modules into `/lib/modules/<kernel_version>-<config_local_version>`. For example, for kernel version 5.14 installed above, they would be copied to `/lib/modules/5.14.5-ARCH`. This keeps the modules for individual kernels used separated.

<!-- Now that the kernel modules are build successfully, we will proceed to install kernel itself -->

### Copy the kernel to /boot directory

The kernel compilation process will generate a compressed `bzImage` (big zImage) of that kernel, which must be copied to the /boot directory and renamed in the process. Provided the name is prefixed with `vmlinuz-`, you may name the kernel as you wish.

```
# cp -v arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-<kernel_name>

cp -v arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-linux514
```

### Make initial RAM disk

Generate initramfs image file
You are free to name the initramfs image file whatever you wish when generating it. However, it is recommended to use the `linux<major_revision><minor_revision>` convention. For example, the name 'linux514' was given as '5' is the major revision and '14' is the minor revision of the 5.14 kernel. This convention will make it easier to maintain multiple kernels, regularly use mkinitcpio, and build third-party modules.

```
# mkinitcpio -k <kernel_version> -g /boot/initramfs-<kernel_name>.img

mkinitcpio -k 5.14.5 -g /boot/initramfs-linux514.img
```

### Copy System.map file

The `System.map` file is not required for booting Linux. It is a type of "phone directory" list of functions in a particular build of a kernel. The System.map contains a list of kernel symbols (i.e function names, variable names etc) and their corresponding addresses.

Copy `System.map` to `/boot`, appending your kernel's name to the destination file. Then create a symlink from `/boot/System.map` to point to `/boot/System.map-<kernel_name>`:

```
cp System.map /boot/System.map-<kernel_name>
ln -sf /boot/System.map-<kernel_name> /boot/System.map
```

## Summary

After completing all steps above, you should have the following 3 files and 1 soft symlink in your `/boot` directory along with any other previously existing files:

- Kernel: `vmlinuz-<kernel_name>`
- Initramfs: `Initramfs-<kernel_name>.img`
- System Map: `System.map-<kernel_name>`
- System Map kernel symlink

## Bootloader configuration

### For grub bootloader

```
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
